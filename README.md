# To-Do List Challenge

Your challenge is to take this partially completed To-Do list application and implement as many of the following requirements listed below as you can.

The application is written in React and uses [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/overview/) as a few of the core components. Feel free to use resources online like Material UI's documentation to help you complete this task.

## Setup

1. `npm install`
2. `npm start`
3. The application will then run on `http://localhost:3000/`.

## Requirements
- User can type in the Create To-Do field.
- Clicking "Create" will create a new To-Do and clear the Create To-Do fields.
- Clicking "Cancel" will clear the Create To-Do fields.
- A list of To-Do items will then be populated.
- Clicking the delete icon will remove the To-Do item.
- Toggling the checkbox will add/remove a strikethrough effect on the To-Do item.
- The To-Do items will show an icon representing its category, if selected.
- The To-Do items will be styled with the icon on the left, if a category is selected, and the title and due date in a left-aligned column on the right, with the icon vertically centered relative to the text.
